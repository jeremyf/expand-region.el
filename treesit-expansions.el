  "Expand the marked region by navigating Tree Sitter's produced syntax tree.

When the region is not active: mark the smallest node at point.

When the region is active:

- Find the smallest node that covers on the region, when its
  range is bigger (and includes) the region, mark that range.

- When that range is exactly the region: try to mark the
  \"inner\" region between the bigger ancestor node (that is
  usually just the immediate parent node)'s first and last named
  node:

        + This region is usually equivalent to
  `er/mark-inside-pairs' but also works for keyword-delimited
  blocks such as begin ... end (if the grammar places them as
  first and last children nodes).

        + The first and last child nodes are unnamed, who are
  delimiters, there must be 2 or mode named nodes between those,
  the intended region includes all named nodes, excludes the
  mandatory preceding and trailing unnamed nodes.

        + The region must be balanced before marking, as some
  grammars let an opening bracket, eg. \"{\" (unnamed node after
  a named node) be a middle child and the closing one, eg. \"}\"
  be the last child, therefore those \"inner\" regions are not
  balanced as it has \"{\" but not \"}\", making it little sense
  to expand.

- When the above expansions can't be found, just mark the bigger
  ancestor node."
